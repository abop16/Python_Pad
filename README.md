# Python_Pad
A simple python text editor for use in linux
I am working on integrating it into a desktop app, but for now it is just a python file.
Icon will be for desktop app
Required libraries:
  tkinter
  pyperclip
  os
  subprocess
  platform

To make into a desktop app:
1: run cat /path/to/pythonpad.desktop > ~/.local/share/applications/pythonpad.desktop in the command line.
2: restart your machine
